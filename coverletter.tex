\begin{cvletter}
   % FIXME
  I am writing to express my interest in the Remote Lead Data Scientist position at XXX. I have over thirteen years of experience managing small-scale biomedical data science projects. I received my Ph.D. in neuroscience in Münster, Germany (2007), where I studied speech perception using experimentation \& biomedical imaging technologies. Before that, as a volunteer student, I began my journey with data using a no. 2 pencil and a microscope in a neuroanatomy lab at UCLA (1999). So I've been around data for over half my life! 

  As a University of Washington (UW) staff research scientist, I have overseen the development of end-to-end data acquisition, wrangling, \& ETL pipelines for experimental human health data, including dense-array timeseries and radiological imaging datasets.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Since my promotion to staff scientist (2014), I have improved the efficiency and replicability of hypothesis testing procedures by leveraging machine learning routines into ETL pipelines for dense array sensor data.
    \item Enhanced testing reliability by daisy chaining ML routines for classification (LOGIT, Regression) and feature selection (random forest) into case-control (A/B testing) pipelines.
    \item As a UW postdoctoral fellow (2011--2014), I used PYTHON programming language to build standardized workflows for reproducible data processing and quality control protocols.
    \item Oversee the strategic planning of paradigms, budgets, and grants---both Federal and Private philanthropic, as well as timely communications of deliverables to business partners.
  \end{itemize}

  Before joining the UW, I was a research fellow at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (2008--2011). I was responsible for devising experimental methods to improve the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children using biomedical data streams.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item I developed a behavioral imaging exam to help classify ASD and controls in an NIH-funded case-control project spanning departments in CHOP and the University of Pennsylvania. The resulting paradigm was published in the journal Neuro Report (2011a).
    \item My paradigm also significantly improved the reliability of pre-operative surgical mapping exams for treatments in pediatric epilepsy. For outstanding translational research, I was awarded an educational loan repayment award by the National Institutes of Health.
  \end{itemize}

  My work is at the intersection of experimental psychology and data science---educated in the former and self-taught in the arts of the latter. I am looking for data scientist roles in the health industry to develop advanced ML \& ethical AI analytics in an agile business environment. I am excited to learn more about the opportunities at XXX and how I can contribute to your team.  %FIXME 

  I look forward to hearing from you to discuss how I can best meet your needs. Thank you for your time and consideration.
