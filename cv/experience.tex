    \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
      \item {Chief technical lead for a series of biomedical imaging data projects to study auditory speech \& language cognition in infants and individuals with autism, generating \$1.5M in funding for the lab.}
      \item {Use Python scientific computing software to manage terabytes of health data for 100+ participants. Established history of contributions to open-source software for automating data operations, including acquisition, QC, ETL workflows, feature engineering, and ML model evaluation.}
      \item {Contributed to Python tools for digital signal processing and analysis of individual health data resulting in faster coding implementation, more robust analysis, and code sharing between co-workers and collaborators. Project code base was featured in a peer-reviewed publication and is actively maintained by a vibrant open-source developer community.}
      \item {Collaborated with co-workers to implement experimental paradigms, and develop strategies for data QC, ETL, and analysis routines, to deliver peer-reviewed publications. I have also successfully advised graduate students on designing their research paradigm, including technical planning for data acquisition and analysis strategies leading to the timely completion of student projects.}
      \item {\textbf{Technical Skills:} Experimentation, Digital Signal Processing, A/B testing, Case Control, Longitudinal Data, EDA, Data visualization (R, Tidyverse), Data Mining, Machine Learning, Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas SQL, Linux, MacOS, Bash Scripting, Git.}
      \item {\textbf{Soft Skills:} Teamwork, Leadership, Time Management, Communication, Presentation skills.}

  {
    \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
      \item {Designed an experimental paradigm to assess language cognition in a large-scale NIH-funded, case-control study of 100+ school-aged participants with autism. The results from the paradigm were published in two peer-reviewed \emph{NeuroReport} articles and awarded an NIH college loan repayment award (\$35k) for outstanding translational research.}
      \item {Resulting paradigm was was incorporated into the Radiology Departments standard battery of preoperative brain mapping exams for pediatric epilepsy patients.}
      \item {Implemented advanced non-parametric statistics for more reliable findings for large-array sensor data resulting in a highly-cited peer-reviewed publication in \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2011.01.015}{Biological Psychiatry}}. 
      \item {Course instructor of departmental seminar on research statistics analysis for first-year medical school residents.}
