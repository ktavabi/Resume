    \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
      \item {I am the chief technical lead for a series of biomedical imaging data projects to study auditory speech & language cognition in infants and individuals with autism, generating \$1.5M in funding for the lab.}
      \item {I use Python scientific computing software to manage terabytes of health data for 100+ participants. I have an established history of contributions to open-source software that automates data operations, including acquisition, QC, ETL workflows, feature engineering, and ML model evaluation.}
      \item {My contributions to Python tools for digital signal processing and analysis of individual health data are featured in peer-reviewed publications, actively maintained by a vibrant open-source developer community, and resulted in faster coding implementation, more robust analysis, and code sharing between co-workers and collaborators.}
      \item {I collaborated with co-workers to implement experimental paradigms, and develop strategies for data QC, ETL, and analysis routines, to deliver peer-reviewed publications. I have also successfully advised graduate students on designing their research paradigm, including technical planning for data acquisition and analysis strategies leading to the timely completion of student projects.}
      \item {\textbf{Technical Skills:} Experimentation, Digital signal processing, A/B testing, Case Control, EDA, Data visualization (R, Tidyverse), Machine Learning, Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas SQL, Linux, MacOS, Bash Scripting, Git.}
      \item {\textbf{Soft Skills:} Teamwork, Leadership, Time Management, Communication, Presentation skills.}

  {
    \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
      \item {In collaboration with psycholinguists at the University of Pennsylvania, I designed an experimental paradigm to examine language cognition in a large-scale 100+ participants, NIH-funded, case-control study of autism in school children. Due to the sensitivity of the exam to language discrimination, The Radiology Department at CHOP  also incorporated the resulting paradigm into the standard battery of preoperative brain mapping in pediatric epilepsy patients. The results from pilot data from my design were published in two peer-reviewed \emph{NeuroReport} articles and garnered an NIH-sponsored college loan repayment award (\$35k) for outstanding translational research.}
      \item {In addition to paradigm development, I successfully analyzed datasets using robust, non-parametric statistics to uncover more reliable findings from large-array sensor data resulting in a highly-cited peer-reviewed publication in \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2011.01.015}{Biological Psychiatry}. Also, to facilitate continuing education for first-year medical school residents, I was a course instructor for the departmental seminar on research statistics analysis.}
      \item {\textbf{Technical Skills:} Case-Control, mixed linear modeling, ANOVA, MATLAB, Spectral analysis.}
      \item {\textbf{Soft Skills:} Teamwork, Presentation Skills, Scientific writing, Grant writing.}
