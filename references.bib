  abstract     = {The development of the Brain Imaging Data Structure ({BIDS}; Gorgolewski et al., 2016) gave the neuroscientific community a standard to organize and share data. {BIDS} prescribes file naming conventions and a folder structure to store data in a set of already existing file formats. Next to rules about organization of the data itself, {BIDS} provides standardized templates to store associated metadata in the form of Javascript Object Notation ({JSON}) and tab separated value ({TSV}) files. It thus facilitates data sharing, eases metadata querying, and enables automatic data analysis pipelines. {BIDS} is a rich system to curate, aggregate, and annotate neuroimaging databases.},

  abstract     = {Skilled reading requires years of practice associating visual symbols with speech sounds. Over the course of the learning process, this association becomes effortless and automatic. Here we test whether automatic activation of spoken-language circuits in response to visual words is a hallmark of skilled reading. Magnetoencephalography was used to measure word-selective responses under multiple cognitive tasks (N = 42, 7–12 years of age). Even when attention was drawn away from the words by performing an attention-demanding fixation task, strong word-selective responses were found in a language region (i.e., superior temporal gyrus) starting at {\textasciitilde}300 ms after stimulus onset. Critically, this automatic word-selective response was indicative of reading skill: the magnitude of word-selective responses correlated with individual reading skill. Our results suggest that auto­ matic recruitment of spoken-language circuits is a hallmark of skilled reading; with practice, reading becomes effortless as the brain learns to automatically translate letters into sounds and meaning.},

  abstract     = {Background: Auditory processing abnormalities are frequently observed in autism spectrum disorders ({ASD}), and these abnormalities may have sequelae in terms of clinical language impairment ({LI}). The present study assessed associations between language impairment and the amplitude and latency of the superior temporal gyrus magnetic mismatch ﬁeld ({MMF}) in response to changes in an auditory stream of tones or vowels.
                  Methods: Fifty-one children with {ASD}, and 27 neurotypical control subjects, all aged 6 to 15 years, underwent neuropsychological evaluation, including tests of language function, as well as magnetoencephalographic recording during presentation of tones and vowels. The {MMF} was identiﬁed in the difference waveform obtained from subtraction of responses to standard from deviant stimuli.
                  Results: Magnetic mismatch ﬁeld latency was signiﬁcantly prolonged (p Ͻ .001) in children with {ASD}, compared with neurotypical control subjects. Furthermore, this delay was most pronounced (ϳ50 msec) in children with concomitant {LI}, with signiﬁcant differences in latency between children with {ASD} with {LI} and those without (p Ͻ .01). Receiver operator characteristic analysis indicated a sensitivity of 82.4\% and speciﬁcity of 71.2\% for diagnosing {LI} based on {MMF} latency.
                  Conclusions: Neural correlates of auditory change detection (the {MMF}) are signiﬁcantly delayed in children with {ASD}, and especially those with concomitant {LI}, suggesting a neurobiological basis as well as a clinical biomarker for {LI} in {ASD}.},

  abstract     = {The functional organization of speech sound processing in the human brain and its unfolding over time are still not well understood. While the N100/N100m is a comparatively well-studied, and quite late, component of the auditory evoked field elicited by speech, earlier processes such as those reflected in the P50m remain to be resolved. Using magnetoencephalography, the present study follows up on previous reports of N100m-centred spatiotemporal encoding of phonological features and coarticulatory processes in the auditory cortex during consonant-vowel syllable perception. Our results indicate that the time course and response strength of the P50m and N100m components of evoked magnetic fields are differentially influenced by mutually exclusive place-of-articulation features of a syllable's stop consonant and vowel segments. Topographical differences in P50m generators were driven by place contrasts between consonants in syllables, with spatial gradients orthogonal to the ones previously reported for N100m. Peak latency results replicated previous findings for the N100m and revealed a reverse pattern for the earlier P50m (shorter latencies depending on the presence of a back vowel [o]). Our findings allow attribution of a role in basic feature extraction to the comparatively early P50m time window. Moreover, the observations substantiate the assumption that the N100m response reflects a more abstract phonological representational stage during speech perception.},

  abstract     = {In casual speech, phonemic segments often assimilate such that they adopt features from adjacent segments, a typical feature being their place of articulation within the vocal tract (e.g., labial, coronal, velar). Place assimilation (e.g., from coronal /n/ to labial /m/: {rainbowR}*raimbow) alters the surface form of words. Listeners’ ability to perceptually compensate for such changes seems to depend on the phonemic context, on whether the adjacent segment (e.g., the /b/ in ‘‘rainbow’’) invites the particular change. Also, some assimilations occur frequently (e.g., /n/R/m/), others are rare (e.g., /m/R/n/). We investigated the effects of place assimilation, its contextual dependency, and its frequency on the strength of auditory evoked mismatch negativity ({MMN}) responses, using pseudowords. Results from magnetoencephalography ({MEG}) revealed that the {MMN} was modulated both by the frequency and contextual appropriateness of assimilations.},

Peak significance between repeated high and low frequency words was evident at {\textasciitilde}365–465ms post target onset.

  abstract     = {As a continuation of the morphometric studies on the preceding paper, here we report on the rate of growth of the caudate nucleus (n.), thalamus, red n., and the substantia (s.) nigra using, with few exceptions, the same cohort of cats. The same previously used brains (n=64 cats) were allocated to the following age groups: fetal (E) 59 days, postnatal (P) days 1, 7, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and 180. Sixteen additional cats, interspersed within the groups, were substituted for the red n. and s. nigra studies. There were six subjects per group (except for E59, n=4). Using a projection microscope and cytochrome oxidase-stained coronal sections, a combined (left plus right sides) total of 4693, 3822, 1636, and 1180 sections were drawn for the caudate, thalamus, s. nigra, and red n., respectively. With computer assistance, the drawings were digitized to calculate mean cross-sectional areas and then the mean volume of each structure per group. The growth time tables for the caudate n., thalamus and s. nigra were fairly synchronous. In terms of percentage of the adult volume, for the left side (both sides grew at a similar rate), the three structures grew at a fast pace between E59 and P30. Thus, at E59 their respective percentages relative to adult volume were 23.7, 29.8 and 22.6\% and by P30 the percentages were within adult range (85.2, 115.1 and 87.5\%, respectively). Starting at P30, for the thalamus and at P45 for the caudate n., there was a consistent tendency to an overgrow which ranged between 4.3 and 30.9\% (at P180, P{\textless}0.5) for the caudate and between 0.3 and 15.1\% for the thalamus. In addition, starting at P30, the right thalamus tended to be consistently larger than the left by a margin ranging between 0.5 and 11.2\% (P120, P{\textless}0.05). The red n. grew at a different, slower pace. Starting from a fetal volume equivalent to an 18.6\% of adult size, its volume was only a 61.0\% of the adult value at P30 and came within range of adulthood size only by P60 (81.3\%). Neither the s. nigra nor the red n. showed any consistent tendency to overgrow or to asymmetry. These findings are discussed in the context of the literature. Furthermore, we discuss general conclusions and considerations pertaining to both papers as well as draw comparisons with the maturational time tables of other developmental landmarks in cats. Finally, in a comparison with growth of human brain structures, we point at the limitations and complexities involved in studying human material and, noting interspecies similarities, we propose that the present data from an advanced gyrencephalic mammal may form the bases for a model of structures maturation in humans.},
